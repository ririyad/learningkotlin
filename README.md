Notes while learning kotlin

## Basic Types

- In Kotlin, everything is an object **type** in the sense that we can call member functions and properties on any variable.
- Basic Types
  - number (Integer [type(bit)]: [Byte(8), Short(16), Int(32), Long(64)] Floating point: [Float(32), Double(64)])
  - characters
  - booleans
  - arrays
  - strings
  - We can use underscore for numeric literals:  
 ```kotlin 
      val oneMillion = 1_000_000
```
